===========

This is a VERY simple, quick and dirty PHP script to automatically send birthday
 SMS's to people (in a school / club / ...) through WinSMS.co.za. It is easy to
 modify the code to use the APIs of other bulk SMS providers. This script can
 even be used if you are very lazy and often forget to send birthday SMS's to
 your friends.

Simply create a database with the fields uid, surname, firstnames, birthday,
 cellno and language. Then edit config.php (descriptions in file). Test it by
 running "php cron.php". If everything seems safe, comment out the lines
 containing "$dryrun" and "$debug" in config.php.

Setup a cron job to run cron.php once every day, eg. at 9 AM. You could
 theoretically set it to anything, but the learners / club members / ...
 won't be very happy to get a SMS at 1 AM!

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
IF YOU LOSE MONEY BY ACCIDENTLY SENDING 1000 SMS'S, THAT ISN'T MY FAULT!
